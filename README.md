# React + Vite
This project is created with Vite with react. React provides a good template for creating Single page applications, which is the reason I have chosen this. 

To run the application on your machine you need to do the following command in a terminal: 

# npm run dev
Afterwords a popup shouls show with a link to a local host. This Link will lead you to the application. 


you can also go to website: https://8rageramberg.github.io/myfilmratings/ 
Currently trying my best to link it to the Custom Domain Name myfilmratings.store but I am currently meeting some troubles.



# Changes made from proposal to prototype:
