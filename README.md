# React + Vite
This project is created with Vite with react. React provides a good template for creating Single page applications, which is the reason I have chosen this. 

To run the application on your machine you need to do the following command in a terminal: 

# npm run dev

Afterwords a popup shouls show with a link to a local host. This Link will lead you to the application.
